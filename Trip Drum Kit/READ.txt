Thank you for downloading the Drumkit from my latest Beat Tape "Trip". 
This kit includes Drum Breaks made by me, Drum One Shots, Fx, Percussion Loops etc. 
Everything here is ROYALTY FREE. If you do end up making something with some of these sounds, feel free to send it to me.

This project was made over the course of two weeks while on my trip to Germany. All the instrumentation was done by me.
